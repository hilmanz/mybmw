                        <p>Away from the asphalt roads, on gravel tracks through sand dunes and dried river deltas, Yennas Chandra has discovered a whole new dimension of driving pleasure behind the wheel of BMW X5.</p>

                            <p>The journey began in the Namibian capital of Windhoek, at the beautiful lodges surrounded by bush and open spaces. Before setting off across the X-routes, all participants were introduced to the BMW team. So, they'll be ready for the first exhilarating drive to the Otjihavera Mountains as the first route. </p>

<p>Yennas has never driven a left-hand-drive car before, but he could easily adapts to the BMW X5 Active Steering which gave him greater stability and comfort to stay in full control of any situation. The first route was quite challenging. He traversed into the canyons and driving through grass and shrub savannah. Even grass and shrub might have a high probability of damaging the exterior, but he found that the high quality of BMW X5 paints had miraculously kept the scratch away. </p>

                            <p>The other route was even more exciting. He had to travel through dried river beds into the Erongo Mountains over the sand, rubble and rocks for an exotic surprise dinner at the top of the rocky hill. It was definitely one of the most unexpected and very memorable moments from this journey.</p>
<p>After the joyful under the starry-skied dinner, Yennas couldn't hide his amazement when he visited the Sandwich Harbor on the next day. It's a towering giant sand dunes that run straight into the ocean, yes, the famous Namibian Sand Sea.</p>
<p>He activated the Hill Descent Control (HDC) right before he slid down the famous sand dunes with BMW X5. The HDC is a smart system that holds the vehicle at a pre-determined speed and helps its brake control so the driver can fully concentrate on the steering wheel. </p>

                        <p>Impressed with the HDC capability, he could also feel the xDrive system adapts perfectly on the way back route that leads him through high extensions of desert dunes and the dry river delta of the Kuiseb River. The xDrive is an intelligent system that drives all the wheels, managing the distribution of the driving force to front and rear wheels for the most challenging road surface conditions. </p>

<p>This entire exhilarating journey ended in Windhoek. Yennas has never expected his first Namibian epic journey was full of unexpected joy and surprises - especially when he experienced it behind the wheel of BMW X5. Definitely a perfect driving experience every BMW enthusiast is looking for.  </p>
